					  The United States Water Patrol was founded on May 4.1999 in Louisville KY.  
					  to assist boaters on the Ohio River and local Lakes. near Louisville, KY and 
					  Southern Indiana. Our duties at that time we limited to towing short distance 
					  only and providing gas and limited assistance. Also at that time the primary					  mission of the U.S.W.P. was assisting boaters.
					The U.S. Water Patrol was officially chartered and registered with the IRS, and 
					the state of Kentucky  in 2001, as a uniformed all volunteer Homeland Security 
					Support and Public Safety organization. The United States Water Patrol's primary 
					mission was changed from it's original concept of Public Safety to Homeland Security 
					Support being our first priority and Public Safety became our secondary mission and 
					extending our service on all waterways within the U.S. as well as assisting in natural 
					disasters when and as needed. We are ready to assist Federal, State and Local authorities 
					in any emergency situation as needed, such as Flooding, Rescue and support. And will 
					continue to do so as long as necessary and the ability to do so. Among Homeland Security 
					duties,

					<h2>Answers</h2>
					<div class="col-sm">
					  Homeland Security 
						Homeland Security is every American's duty to help guard and protect the United States from harm.  
						We also feel that there is a need for organized and trained people who know what and where to look for 
						possible problems and how to respond to them. Also, we do this because we want to give something of ourselves 
						to our country and other people; and also make it a little safer and better for us all.  
						Public Safety
						If you are a boater this will not be a surprise to you. There is a great need for assistance on the water. 
						There are a lot of things that can go wrong while out on or around the water. There are limited resources for 
						you to call upon. We help by providing assistance to the public. Have you ever ran out of gas or needed a tow. 
						Most boaters will come to another boaterâ€™s aid, but by not knowing what to do can sometimes cause more problems. 
						Also most boaters do not always know what to look for in spotting others in need. If you call for help you could 
						be charged a large amount for assistance or a tow. 
						I don't think you will find very many people out on the water whose only purpose is to assist the public in 
						Safety and Security just for the joy of doing it.
